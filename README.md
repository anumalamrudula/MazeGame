# MazeGame
 
The GUI provides a high-level conceptual understanding of pathfinding algorithms. 
There are 2 models of GUI:
    (1) Game Mode => A simple maze game, a bit like Pac-Man, gives us a sense of how the virtual opponent uses three different path finding algorithms to beat us in finding a piece of treasure.
    (2) Explore Mode => We can see the path taken from an individual position to a goal position using those same algorithms in several different mazes provided as text files. Click to place treasure in the maze.
    
Buttons at the top:
    (1) We can Reset
    (2) We can decide whether we want the path to be shown or not
    (3) Choice of 3 Algorithms => DFS, BFS, A*(Goes straight for the Goal)
    
Press 's' and then the opponent start looking for the treasure (in yellow color). Beat the opponent to find the treasure.

Do 'pip install playsound' to enable sound.
